        <h1>Different types of Roasts</h1>
        <p>
            There are several different types of roasts, however there are three main ones that we will cover. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>Medium</li>
            <li>Dark</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Different tastes can only be found in different types of roasts.
            For example, light roasts are good for tasting floral, fuity, and biscutty notes. 
            Medium can have cereal, chocolate, and earthy notes.
            Dark roasts consist of smokey, cocao, woody, and spice notes. 
            Some places will make their coffee complex by doing a "split roast". 
            This is where you take two seperate roasted batches, a light roast with fuity notes, 
            and a dark roast with cocoa notes, and create a complex tasting coffee.
