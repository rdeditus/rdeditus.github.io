        <strong><em>There are three main species of coffee beans.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Arabica - Most favored</li>
        <li>Robusta - Cheapest</li>
        <li>Liberica - Not so known</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Arabica</strong> is seen as a higher quality bean due to its taste. However it can be difficult to grow, as it requires very specific growing conditions and is also suseptable to various diseases and pests.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Robusta</strong> is seen as a harder plant that grows larger than Arabica, and also has a higher amount of caffiene content. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Liberica</strong> has a caffiene content in between Arabica and Robusta, mostly famous in the Phillipines and is grown in South Asia.
